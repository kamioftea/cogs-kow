All attendees, sponsors, and volunteers at our events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. 
Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a 
safe environment for everybody.

## The Quick Version

<p class="lead">
    Chesterfield Open Gaming Society is dedicated to providing an inclusive, harassment-free gaming experience for
    everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
    appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or hobby choices. We do not tolerate harassment
    of event participants in any form. 
</p>
<p class="lead">
    This applies to our events, as well as to any associated social events and posts on Facebook and other online 
    media. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the
    discretion of the organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, hobby choices, sexual images in
public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
games or other activities at the event, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate,
including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one
of the event organisers immediately. It will be made announced who these are in the event pack, and on the day during 
the event introductions.

You can also contact the following Chesterfield Open Gaming Society committee members regarding any event run by or on 
behalf of the society.

We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules during club events, as well as to any associated social events and when
posting about the event or Chesterfield Open Gaming Society on Facebook and other online media.
