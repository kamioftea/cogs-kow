	<h2>Club Nights</h2>
	<p>
		As well as the organised play events, we also play Kings of War games on regular gaming
		club nights.
	</p>

	<p>
		Club nights are every Monday (except Bank Holidays), and the second and fourth Wednesdays of
		the month. They run from 19:00 to 22:00, which is usually adequate for a 2000 point game, or
		two 1000 point games. They are held at
		<a href="https://parishcentrestonegravels.co.uk/">The Parish Centre, Stonegravels</a>:
	</p>

		Please arrange a game with an opponent beforehand, or come to one of our dedicated Kings of
		War evenings. The next of these is Monday 12th December,
