## Prepare for battle

<p class="lead">
  Announcing Twilight Expansion. A six-month-long escalation campaign using the Kings of War 3.5 edition rules.

The campaign will be played on the <abbr title="Chesterfield Open Gaming Society">COGS</abbr> club nights. We will start
with a 500 point Ambush! game in January growing to 2300 points in June. Players will be encouraged to record the 
narrative of their campaign force as the campaign unfolds.

The full rules pack and sign-up will be available at the start of December.
